# FLOSSY

(Fit Linear periOd-Spacing patternS interactivelY)

## Physical context

Period-spacing patterns are an asteroseismic tool that probes the near-core regions of a star. Tassoul 1980 predicts the period of gravity modes to be equidistant (i.e.  constant ΔP) for a spherical chemically-homogeneous non-rotating star. Keppler and TESS observations have revealed a variety of non-constant patterns in plots of ΔP vs P whose signatures have been associated with the physic inside the star. For instance, Miglio et al. 2008 linked the dips in such patterns to gradients in the star's chemical composition and Van Reeth et al. 2015abc established the relation between the pattern's slope and the interior rotation. The community is currently working on mathematical descriptions (e.g. Townsend 2003, Cunha et al. 2019) and, at the same time, using these patterns as constraints on forward asteroseismic modelling to probe the physics near the stellar core (e.g. Pedersen et al. 2021).

Period-spacing patterns are ultimately identified manually, especially when they are used for forward asteroseismic modelling (Aerts et al. 2018). FLOSSY aims to facilitate this task by offering an interactive tool that lets the user search the ΔP pattern in a previously computed periodogram while offering diagnostic plots as the  ΔP vs P and the period Echelle diagram, both often used to spot and confirm the pattern. FLOSSY assumes that the ΔP changes at a linear rate w.r.t. P and uses the same parametrization as Li et al. 2019.
